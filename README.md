# Hi there, it's Dez here ðŸ‘‹!
---

I started coding in basic. But I stopped. Sometimes in the 80s.
Then HTML, CSS in the late 90s. 
Then Wordpress in the early 2000s. 
Then Jamstack in the mid 2015s. Mostly jekyll. After I learnt some ruby, trying to dable with Sinatra. 
Now I'm learning python and javascript (and Vue/Nuxt.)

Also, I'm a tech talent sourcer (since 2019.)
